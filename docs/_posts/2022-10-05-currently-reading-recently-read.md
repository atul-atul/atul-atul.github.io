The Splendid And The Vile A Saga Of Churchill, Family And Defiance During The Blitz- Erik Larson. 
'It was the best of the times, it was the worst of the times.' The book talks about Churchill's leadership before USA joined the war, his diplomacy to keep France going, his go-to people (what interesting insights!), family... A lot of book chronicles diary entries of various people around the PM- his secretary, daughter, letters between his sort of debt ridden son and son's wife, ego clashes, his speeches, inspiring visits to the bombed areas, etc. His opinions about India and attitude towards the Indian Freedom Stuggle and peopl asife (expressed elsewhere), Churchill was a great wartime leader.

Rao knew many languages, could write programs in cobol, shell scripts, and complained the new updates to his word processor program were just cosmetic. Before 1991 budget was presented, Rao rejected a safe-playing draft asking Dr. Singh (as per an un-named witness)- if this was what I wanted, why would I have asked you to be the finance minister.
