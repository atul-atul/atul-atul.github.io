IOU stands for "I owe you". Software engineering being a relatively new field borrowed quite a few ideas via mechanisms like metaphor, simile, lift and shift, etc. Here I plan to write about some such instances. Some of it is only natural when IT enables other industries and domain terminologies get mainstream. Otherwise, in a virtual world of software what do things like spreadsheet, ledger, transactions, end-of-day even mean? If Newton hears about brute 'force' solutions or sprint 'velocity', he will start turning in his grave in the abby and won't stop unless acted upon by an external agency which he named as force. But it's ok because these terms have became mainstream and have acquired overloaded meanings.

Some people like Martin Fowler, Alan Kay, UX people are good at this cross discipline terminologies. Some things like buttons, window, etc. are easy to adopt. (Maybe they look easy in hindsight?) But some are more conceptual. For example, Alan Kay came up with the idea of Object Oriented programming and says that the essence of it is in self contained cells communicating via message passing. The inspiration was animal/ plant cells which communicate within themselves and with other cells via amino acids, electrochemical signals.

Of course, software is not the only field borrowing terms and metaphors- other fields do that, too. For example, without a 'wingman' you might have made some 'unforced errors'. Anyway, you will appreciate that Jerry really 'aces' this [bit about baseball terms](https://youtu.be/HAsBk9Eia8A?t=3328), doesn't he? Of course, if you are in office this video is a 'no-ball' and it may give your boss/ offended coworker 'a free hit'.

I will update this once in a while like some other posts here: [quotes](https://atul-atul.github.io/quotes/), a post about [short takes](https://atul-atul.github.io/notes/Short-Takes/) on some concepts, etc. The trigger for starting this was that I came across a new concept- mechanical sympathy- yesterday. 

1. **Scrum:** Well, let's start lightly. A scrummage, commonly known simply as a scrum, is a method of restarting play in rugby football that involves players packing closely together with their heads down and attempting to gain possession of the ball. An engineer from google- in a post on quora- dismissed daily stand-up/ status meetings as Alcoholics Anonymous kind of charade.
2. **Technical Debt:** The concept of debt as something you have to repay or face consequences was borrowed for badly written code/ badly designed systems and architectures.
3. **Mechanical Sympathy:** If while writing software you are aware of the underlying hardware then you have mechanical sympathy. Borrowed from mechanical/ automobile engineering- while driving a car, if you know..., etc. At one point, mobile phones had limited memory and at some other point commodity hardware got preferred over server grade machines. But apart from that I have never really bothered much about knowing deeply about hardware. Yet, if you go through some videos like [Mythbusting Modern Hardware to Gain 'Mechanical Sympathy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC1EKLQ2Wmg) or [quicker sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0VQroDAkGs), you will appreciate that having swami like awareness of hardware may help you reach a state of nirvana. Of course, this should extend to other areas like network protocols, etc. But it generally does not for most of us. It's acceptable I think. But that's why there is Niklaus [Wirth's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law). Also take a look at Gates' law/ May's law in the same wiki entry.
4. **Bug:** The first bug was a moth or something that hindered working of the mechanical (?)/ analog/ Cathode Ray(?) computer. Bug, scientifically, is an insect that sucks (blood, food, etc.). So not all insects are bugs. I don't think that nuance got translated to software.
5. **Bulkhead:** Idea borrowed from ships to partition and restrict failures to limited area. Titanic did not have good bulkheads.
6. **Circuit breaker:** When some part of circuit gets overloaded/ exposed to high voltage, the circuit is broken and damage to entire system/ its large part is avoided.
7. Too familiar terms and ideas like machine, mechanism, transaction, atoms (erlang, elixir, clojure), page, switch, objects, quorum, consensus, broadcast, etc. are all borrowed.
8. Big Ball of mud
9. Yak shaving
10. Project farming, cellular architectures, cross pollination, etc.
11. Watches, barriers, etc.
12. Plumbing, porcelein, pipe, streams, scope 'creep', etc.
13. Algorithms (at least names) like leaky bucket, sliding window.
14. OO Design patterns like bridge, facade, factory, etc.
15. Head, tail, push, pop.
16. Tracer bullet, fanout, shotgun surgery, garbage collection, etc.
17. Rubber duck debugging (borrowed from English baths, I imagine. I remember [Bertie in bath with a duck](https://youtu.be/yMPuROQMBuw?t=982) on a few occasions).
18. (Enough for today, I think. Will update occassionally. But I will try to add short descriptions than just list the terms as in a few of above bullet points.)
