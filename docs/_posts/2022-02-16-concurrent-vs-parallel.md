This is the most simplified version of the difference between the two concepts I have found. It is from Joe Armstrong's [blog](https://joearms.github.io/#2013-04-05%20Concurrent%20and%20Parallel%20Programming). And if anyone knows the difference it'd be Joe.

Why copy it here? 1. So that I can recall it faster than searching for it on the net. 2. If his blogs goes away, I have a backup. 3. If anyone stumbles on my blog, they can benefit from it.

Here it is:

What's the difference between concurrency and parallelism? Explain it to a five year old.
