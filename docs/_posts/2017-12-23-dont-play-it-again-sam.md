What kind of non-sense is this? Search for theÂ  blog post titled E Pur Si Muove by Altman. I don't want to link to it.

A few things to note: he's clarified a few things in his subsequent post. So there is that. But if you are influential, as he no doubt is, you should be a little bit careful in the first place.

However, still a few things.

English word demagogue means a leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power. I could say that in that post China is mentioned so as to he could use that as a fear factor/ prejudice in American mind about China.

Next, subtle use of 'with us or with the terrorists'. By claiming that his kind of people are the ones saying that the earth is round and evolution is real, he's trying to paint others as catholic church of that era. If only it was so black and white.
