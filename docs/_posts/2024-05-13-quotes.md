11. You must be the change you wish to see in the world. Gandhi
12. There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures. Shakespeare
13. Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years. Bill Gates

    1. Till recently, I thought it was from the novel.
18. Our life is frittered away by detail... simplify, simplify. Thoreau
    1. Sounds great. And I agree with Simplify...Simplify thing. But what do you identify as detail?

    1. I have come across a few similar quotes. (Atticus Finch comes first to mind. "Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets.")
    2. No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which may be true. - Recently I came across a variant of this Nathaneil Hawthorne quote in Sopranos.

    1.  It is kind of weird that the people you wish wouldn't hurt you are the ones who hurt you deeply. The family, close friends, etc. The people you went out of your way to make comfortable are likely to be the people who cause you most discomfort. 
24. [I will never understand people. They are the worst.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJXejD_FEXs)

28. A person's success in life is determined by having a high minimum, not a high maximum. If you can do something really well but there are other things at which you're failing, the latter will hold you back. But if almost everything you do is up there, then you've got a good life. And so I try to learn how to get through things that others find unpleasant.- Donald Knuth
29. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
    1. This is one version of [the serenity prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer).
    2. Of course, if you want to lead an interesting life your prayer could be the [Calvin And Hobbes version](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/08/28): the strength to change what I can, the inability to accept what I can't, and the incapacity to tell the difference.
 30. Apologies, once postponed, became harder and harder to make, and finally impossible.- Margaret Mitchell in Gone With the Wind.
 31. From recently read Call for the Dead (The first book in the Smiley series by John le Carré. And probably because it's the author's early work, it's not as good or complex as A Spy Who Came In From The Cold or Tinker Tailor... or Honorable Schoolboy or Smiley's People. I have read these before but planning to re-read. Just for the complexity... There the plots are as complex as Wodehouse's. Which reminds me of another quote/ tweet... Programmers are attracted to the complexity like moths to flames.)
     1.  It dawned on him gradually that he had entered middle age without ever being young.
         1.  That feeling. 
     2.  It's the devil you don't know that gets you.
     3.  Everything he admired or loved had been the product of intense individualism...When had mass philosophies ever brought benefit or wisdom?
     4.  When he closed his eyes they seemed to turn inwards on the chaos of his brain.
 32. From another recently read book A Murder of Quality Second book in the Smiley series by John le Carré (Again not as good or complex as the latter books in the Smiley series.)
     1.  What a shame, thought Fielding, that a mind so perceptive of beauty had no talent for creation.
     2.  It was a peculiarity of Smiley’s character that throughout the whole of his clandestine work he had never managed to reconcile the means to the end.
     3.  Smiley was not opposed to social distinctions but he liked to make his own.
         1.  The novel has a background of English class system as seen in public (private, really) schools. 
         2.  And if you need a bit of fun poked at the class system, here is [Stephen Fry on the receiving end on QI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fki5pi_Y5IY&ab_channel=QI) (mostly) because of his posh background. It has my favorite Knock Knock joke. Stephen is gifted in the areas of telling jokes [as in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1AZYCwcvTU&ab_channel=QI) and stories like [the late queen elbowing him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNMcvqqLXGk&ab_channel=QI) or his [Norfolk tea party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7YRGAs0kFA&ab_channel=TheGrahamNortonShow). Of course, the idea of Hugh Laurie or [Rowan Atkinson](https://youtu.be/TbNRPW3m4Jc?t=512) vacuuming Fry's carpet is interesting but what's more interesting is that Charles, the current King and then [Prince of Wales thought that he's being shouted at and addressed as Charlie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guQVrev-GXk&ab_channel=U) by Hugh Laurie's wife. Also, people probably loved Princess Diana because even though from the Royal family, [she seemed more accessible](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HLY1xqIJXGU), more human and more like them. Of course, some people are [posh and repressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCDiVfSBHFk&ab_channel=WILTY%3FNope%21) so the class system cuts both ways.
         3.  Above I posted three different links to a single Stephen Fry story. The first two are there because of difference in the detail (Mr. Bean and Bertie Wooster vacuuming). The last one was for adding the context to Spitting Image thing. Princess Diana liked watching it even though it did- at that time- make fun of the Royal Family. 
         4.  Lastly, in Alan Carr's video there is a reference to Inca vs Aztec on QI. So, I could not resist one of my favorite QI clips: [pink polenta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdI1ZEjA7ys).
 33. Haven't you ever happened to come across in a book some vague notion that you've had, some obscure idea that returns from afar and that seems to express completely your most subtle feelings?- Gustave Flaubert
 34. "The world strips you of everything - belief, kindness, trust, innocence. Then you must learn to choose these values. All of these eventually become a choice, not the natural way of being." [from a tweet](https://x.com/GurpriyaSidhu/status/1918368828553404708).
 35. "Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?"- The Godfather [opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZHsmb4ezEk)
 36. "When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible." from the movie in which Meg Ryan says 'I need a kleenex'.
        1. I guess this might be true for many things- not just love. 
        2. Assuming that the quote is true, is the converse(?) also true? Suppose you don't start/ want to start something ASAP, does it mean you are not fully sold on that thing?
37. "We need new versions of history to allow for our current prejudices."- Calvin and Hobbes
38. "If Michelangelo were a heterosexual, the Sistine Chapel would have been painted basic white and with a roller."- Rita Mae Brown. Not sure if it's actual quote but it makes sense to some degree.
39. [This advice/ quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv9SQlcLyPM&t=3631s) about reading poetry resonated.
40. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.- Albert Einstein
41. Mr Bond, they have a saying in Chicago: 'Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action'.- Goldfinger
