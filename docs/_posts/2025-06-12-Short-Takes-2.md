In the [short-takes](/tags/#short-takes) posts I write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas, whatever related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. ## PuLa
   There are very few people, possibly there isn't even one, who I admire as much as I admire late [PuLa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande). I am sure I will be able write more than 100 pages about him. But in short here on his official death anniversary (he was on ventilator for a few days). 
   
   Thanks to him I got introduced to a lot of good things which have stayed long with me- from eating fish to reading Wodehouse. A few people you admire have a very high global maxima. But as you age, local maximas start looking more important than fluck, and you want to keep your local minimas as high as possible. I guess that could also be one reason why I admire various aspects of PuLa personality. More important factor is that this admiration, respect, etc. for PuLa has lived long for me. As I matured I understood some of his shortcomings and limitations, etc. But I also appreciated some other things which I did not earlier. For example, his writing is limited to Marathi language. It is not easily translated to other cultures, languages, etc. In one speech, he himself says that humor and poetry are rooted deeply in the language in which they are written and cannot be easily taken out. So he was aware of this. Second, many of his plays (excluding 'Tuze Ahe Tujpashi') are musical comedies, lacking drama. His translations (Pygmalion to Ti Phulrani, Old Man And The Sea- Eka Koliyane) are also said to lose something in translation. (On the other hand, he reworked some portions of Pickwick Papers into- deeply rooted into Marathi- the iconic Batatyachi Chawl.) And when he wrote about people he met in real life (Raosaheb, for example) the balance which he struck between his admiration and knowing that the person he was writing about was not perfect is just breathtaking. I started appreciating this only after a friend pointed it out to me. It is very difficult balance to achieve. His fine observation skills, humor, music, etc. are discussed and admired- almost worshipped- a lot. I also admire him because he worked in many areas (writing, films, music, plays, social activities, speaking truth to power, etc.) and in all these areas he did good- almost excelled. He was not always successful (the 'Subkuch PuLa' movie 'GuLaacha Ganpati', for example). But wherever he went he created a happy place. I don't know a single- a single- person who did this better than him. I am not saying he was Da Vinci. But, anyway. In one QI episode Ronnie Ancona called Stephen Fry a renaissance man. I think PuLa was the same.
   
   In one interview PuLa mentions that he wrote as if he was speaking to someone sitting in front of him. Because I admired his writing I also picked this way of writing to some extent (Wodehouse must have contributed, as well). And at times it is annoying. Why should I write that way when I am writing some technical notes? It makes you somewhat dependent on mostly unappreciative readers. 
   
   But perhaps the thing that I admire most in him is that he was very appreciative of quality in people and things. Here by appreciative I mean he was able to spot talent. He spotted, praised, and encouraged talent. Here are some examples, the first performance late Bhimsen Joshi in Pune was at PuLa's place. The first letter saying 'I liked your poems' to the then unknown poet Mahanor was by PuLa. He was the first to support Dalit literature.
