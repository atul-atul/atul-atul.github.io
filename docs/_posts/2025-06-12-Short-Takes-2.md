In the [short-takes](/tags/#short-takes) posts I write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas, whatever related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. ## PuLa
   There are very few people, possibly there isn't even one, who I admire as much as I admire late [PuLa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande).
   
   Thanks to him I got introduced to a lot of good things which have stayed long with me- from eating fish to reading Wodehouse. 
   
   An important factor is that this admiration, respect, etc. for PuLa has lived long for me. As I matured, I understood some of his shortcomings and limitations, etc. But I also appreciated some other things which I did not earlier. For example, his writing is limited to Marathi language. It is not easily translated to other cultures, languages, etc. In one speech, he himself says that [humor and poetry are rooted deeply in the language in which they are written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL2PMoHZsbg&t=435s) and cannot be easily lifted and shifted. So he was aware of this. Second, many of his plays (excluding 'Tuze Ahe Tujpashi') are musical comedies, lacking drama. His translations (Pygmalion to 'Ti Phulrani', Old Man And The Sea- 'Eka Koliyane') are also said to lose something in translation. On the other hand, he reworked some portions of Pickwick Papers into- deeply rooted into Marathi- the iconic 'Batatyachi Chawl'. And when he wrote about people he met in real life ([Raosaheb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zahEY_JKF7o), for example) the balance which he struck between his admiration and knowing that the person he was writing about was not perfect is just breathtaking. I started appreciating this only after a friend pointed it out to me. It is a very difficult balance to achieve. 
   
   His fine observation skills, humor, music, etc. are discussed and admired- almost worshipped- a lot. I also admire him because he worked in many areas (writing, films, music, plays, social activities, speaking truth to power, etc.) and in all these areas he did good- almost excelled. He was not always successful (the 'Subkuch PuLa' movie 'GuLaacha Ganpati', for example). But wherever he went he created a happy place. I don't know a single- a single- person who did this better than him. I am not saying he was Leonardo Da Vinci. But, anyway. In one QI episode Ronnie Ancona called [Stephen Fry a renaissance man](https://youtu.be/oSKNqpRgjq8?list=PLci687eliKhvL-_gTLB5uz07HZigy3Y_X&t=469). I think PuLa was the same.
   
   In one interview PuLa mentions that [he wrote as if he was speaking to someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ha3og_vvsw&t=523s) sitting in front of him. Because I admired his writing I also picked this way of writing to some extent (Wodehouse must have contributed, as well). And at times it is annoying. Why should I write that way when I am writing some technical notes? It makes you somewhat dependent on mostly apathetic readers.
   
   But perhaps the thing that I admire most in him is that he was very appreciative of quality in people and things. Here by appreciative I mean he spotted, praised, and [encouraged](https://youtu.be/bAtkxZai3fE?t=539) talent early on. Here are some examples, [the first performance](https://youtu.be/1aKx2umllPM?t=1393) of late [Bhimsen Joshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimsen_Joshi) in Pune was at PuLa's place. [The first letter saying 'I liked your poems'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XmUaYiy3Xk&t=1384s) to the then unknown poet [Mahanor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdeo_Dhondo_Mahanor) was by PuLa. He was the first to support the Dalit literature (He wrote a forward to Anand Yadav's book and told Narayan Surve that [his poem MoneyOrder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-Y_fVYs2SA) stunned him). I may not be a people person like PuLa but I hope and strive to appreciate good things like he did.
2. ## Madeleine moment
   Also known as [involuntary memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory). What was the most recent (and somewhat dramatic) Madeleine moment you experienced? I recently spent a few weekends away from city. And once saw quite a few fireflies. Some memories were triggered. But those were neither dramatic nor quite close to heart. I should meditate more.
3. ## Language and script (in entertainment)
   Language is something that is primarily spoken. Script is written. [Anurag Kashyap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Kashyap) says- [in this interview](https://youtu.be/V5M4cIeWoMQ?t=393)- that from Rangeela onwards movies started using spoken language more than language in its pure, polished form. Their (Ram Gopal Varma and Anurag Kashyap) movie Satya has long been a favorite. But I remember I didn't understand some of the language nuances and a senior friend had to explain those to me. Even now, the expletive packed language of north Indian cinema is not for me. I do use expletives. But while, for example, the raw language fits well in [Gangs of Wasseypur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_of_Wasseypur) movies, I don't like blatant use of such language everywhere. In fact, I think [Panchyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayat_(TV_series)), very good as it is, would have been much better if they had minded their language. I think TVF realized it and later toned down the language in their new series Gram Chikitsalay. But whether polished or raw, language works if set [in appropriate context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk33wRMKa7M). Insist on pure language and you get Dharmendra's character from Chupke Chupke. (BTW, I like Amitabh's character more- 'Aap jaisi khoobsoorat ladki ko botany nahi literature lena chahiye tha', 'muz jaisa nishap, nirdosh lekin majboor character tumhein literature mein bhi nahi milega'.)
5. ## Thought subversion is difficult
   What kind of thought subversion are we comfortable with? For example, if you are from India/ Asia or were born in a religion that originated in India, would you be able to believe that Karma does not exist, that you are not reborn, that no energy flows thr' your spine? Well, I could not do it. Christian folks may find it difficult to not believe in Original Sin. Is there any reason why one should think that life is sacred? I don't bother about past/ future lives but that is when I am thinking/ acting consciously. But the shackles of Karma are difficult to shake off. And as a result I find it easier (and I am almost sure that you'll find it illogical) to reconcile that while maybe past/ future lives don't exist, there are [Samskara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)) or [Saṅkhāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra) due to karma in this life. But if someone argues with me that all that samskara thing is just escapism non-sense, I would not be able to counter that person well. Yet, such things have a hold on us. Ok, forget religious, spiritual things. Here is some text from Feynman's book 'Surely, You're Joking, Mr. Feynman': *'Von Neumann gave me an interesting idea: that you don't have to be responsible for the world that you're in. So I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility as a result of Von Neumann's advice. It's made me a very happy man ever since. But it was Von Neumann who put the seed in that grew into my active irresponsibility!'* While I fully understand that it is a healthy attitude, I have not been able to have that even for short periods of time. Why do ideas, thoughts have such suffocating hold on us? Maybe I am someone who takes themselves/ their ideas more seriously than they should. Maybe it is due to culture, inbreeding, geography, system around us. Actionable part is: how can we escape such holds? Maybe create an environment/ ecosystem around us which promotes different thoughts, and think deeply. What else?
6. ## Test cricket and changing tastes
   I did not like Test cricket in the past. It's not easy to find time to watch a match that can go on for 5 days (for men) and still end in a draw. But sometimes you can watch some of it over the weekend, in the background, in the evening thanks to timezone differences, etc. There's no doubt T20 and One Day matches are here to take cricket forward and Test cricket will eventually be at their mercy. In fact, it already is. There are fewer Tests and some cricket playing countries have more or less given up on it (in spirit, at least). There is even talk of shortening it to 4 days, etc. But putting aside instant gratification if you develop a taste for it, you start appreciating a drawn match or series, and even a maiden over. I watched more Test cricket in last 10 years or so than I did before. And in recent years, I have come to the conclusion that if you don't appreciate Test cricket, you simply don't understand cricket. Current favorite series- the Ashes, Border-Gavaskar trophy, Anderson-Tendulkar trophy, and maybe WTC. Sadly, there aren't many countries willing to spend on Test cricket. Teams play but most of the times there's no heart into it. Teams like Pak, SL have gone downhill due to politics, etc. And capitalism has tilted the balance towards shorter formats. And yet, in the last 5 years, there have been Test matches and series which will be remembered for long.
   
   When the changeover from the likes of Sachin, Dravid, Ganguly was taking place in Indian Cricket, a lot of things were changing- Social media, IPL, Indian cricket had more money, Mumbai was ceding ground to towns like Ranchi. I didn't like the bearded young fellows of Indian cricket with weird nicknames (Sir, Gabbar), their antics on the ground and in front of camera, and who were comfortable with being- for the want of a better word- themselves. I thought that they were playing to the gallery. And yet today I appreciate Ravindra Jadeja. Frankly, I never thought he would last this long in the Indian side. And while I still think Rishabh Pant should ignore cameras and save risky shots for the IPL, there's no doubt that he brings a lot to the Indian team. Recent players are more confident, gritty. It's like Gen Z (or whatever you want to call them) people are more themselves and are breaking the mould like they do in corporate offices. And while each generation is different from the previous one, maybe there are second order effects of social media, and certainly of India's 1991 reforms as well.
7. ## Dentists
   Why do lady dentists have the habit of engaging you in, you know, small talk when you are in the dentist's chair?
8. ## End of an era in Tennis
   There isn't always a single definite point in the arrow of time at which we can say a new era has begun and the old one's gone. There is a transition which takes place where people, objects, practices, customs, and cultures change, and the old makes way for the new. The transition may not be, but generally is, gradual. While the new is getting established, the old may make and succeed in the last ditch attempts to survive and flourish. And yet the old has to go. It is the way of life. There may be some catalysts during this changeover. For example, the second world war accelerated the dismantling of the British empire, French, Russian revolutions and corresponding changes in regimes and societies, etc.

   One such transition has recently taken place... in men's tennis. The Big Three (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic) are gone; the Big Four if you include Murray. 
    <br><br><img src="/images/TheTennisBigFour.jpg" style="width:500px;"/><br><br>
   Well, Djokovic is still not retired and you may think why should he be considered as gone if he can reach semifinals of all four grand slams this year. In that sense he will make some spirited efforts to win next few championships and may win some. Just like Federer did. But Djokovic's play being somewhat mechanical, there is no obvious weakness to work on or gap to bridge (unlike Federer where he improved his backhand dramatically and won the 2017 Aus Open). Most likely, this- being somewhat mechanical- made Djokovic a little boring for me. He's the best returner, if your broke his serve chances were he'd break back right in the next game, etc. Of course, his mental toughness was extraordinary (for example, 2019 Wimbledon final). So certainly there's heart in it; it's not all mechanical. Anyway, coming back to transition [this tweet](https://x.com/BenRothenberg/status/1964161673423462746) should give us some idea. Here's the image from the tweet:
