In the [short-takes](/tags/#short-takes) posts I write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas, whatever related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. ## PuLa
   There are very few people, possibly there isn't even one, who I admire as much as I admire late [PuLa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande).
   
   Thanks to him I got introduced to a lot of good things which have stayed long with me- from eating fish to reading Wodehouse. 
   
   An important factor is that this admiration, respect, etc. for PuLa has lived long for me. As I matured, I understood some of his shortcomings and limitations, etc. But I also appreciated some other things which I did not earlier. For example, his writing is limited to Marathi language. It is not easily translated to other cultures, languages, etc. In one speech, he himself says that humor and poetry are rooted deeply in the language in which they are written and cannot be easily lifted and shifted. So he was aware of this. Second, many of his plays (excluding 'Tuze Ahe Tujpashi') are musical comedies, lacking drama. His translations (Pygmalion to 'Ti Phulrani', Old Man And The Sea- 'Eka Koliyane') are also said to lose something in translation. On the other hand, he reworked some portions of Pickwick Papers into- deeply rooted into Marathi- the iconic 'Batatyachi Chawl'. And when he wrote about people he met in real life (Raosaheb, for example) the balance which he struck between his admiration and knowing that the person he was writing about was not perfect is just breathtaking. I started appreciating this only after a friend pointed it out to me. It is a very difficult balance to achieve. 
   
   His fine observation skills, humor, music, etc. are discussed and admired- almost worshipped- a lot. I also admire him because he worked in many areas (writing, films, music, plays, social activities, speaking truth to power, etc.) and in all these areas he did good- almost excelled. He was not always successful (the 'Subkuch PuLa' movie 'GuLaacha Ganpati', for example). But wherever he went he created a happy place. I don't know a single- a single- person who did this better than him. I am not saying he was Leonardo Da Vinci. But, anyway. In one QI episode Ronnie Ancona called [Stephen Fry a renaissance man](https://youtu.be/oSKNqpRgjq8?list=PLci687eliKhvL-_gTLB5uz07HZigy3Y_X&t=469). I think PuLa was the same.
   
   In one interview PuLa mentions that he wrote as if he was speaking to someone sitting in front of him. Because I admired his writing I also picked this way of writing to some extent (Wodehouse must have contributed, as well). And at times it is annoying. Why should I write that way when I am writing some technical notes? It makes you somewhat dependent on mostly apathetic readers. 
   
   But perhaps the thing that I admire most in him is that he was very appreciative of quality in people and things. Here by appreciative I mean he spotted, praised, and encouraged talent early on. Here are some examples, the first performance of late [Bhimsen Joshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimsen_Joshi) in Pune was at PuLa's place. The first letter saying 'I liked your poems' to the then unknown poet [Mahanor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdeo_Dhondo_Mahanor) was by PuLa. He was the first to support the Dalit literature (He wrote a forward to Anand Yadav's book and told Narayan Surve that [his poem MoneyOrder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-Y_fVYs2SA) stunned him). I may not be a people person like PuLa but I hope and strive to appreciate good things like he did.
2. ## Madeleine moment
   Also known as [involuntary memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory). What was the most recent (and somewhat dramatic) Madeleine moment you experienced? I recently spent a few weekends away from city. And once saw quite a few fireflies. Some memories were triggered. But those were neither dramatic nor quite close to heart. I should meditate more.
3. ## Language and script (in entertainment)
   Language is primarily something that is spoken. Script is written. [Anurag Kashyap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Kashyap) says- [in this interview](https://youtu.be/V5M4cIeWoMQ?t=393)- that from Rangeela onwards movies started using spoken language more than language in its pure, polished form. Their (Ram Gopal Varma and Anurag Kashyap) movie Satya has long been a favorite. But I remember I didn't understand some of the language nuances and a senior friend had to explain those to me. Even now, the expletive packed language of north Indian cinema is not for me. I do use expletives. But while, for example, the raw language fits well in [Gangs of Wasseypur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_of_Wasseypur) movies, I don't like blatant use of such language everywhere. In fact, I think [Panchyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayat_(TV_series)), very good as it is, would have been much better if they had minded their language. I think TVF realized it and later toned down the language in their new series Gram Chikitsalay. But whether polished or raw, language works if set [in appropriate context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk33wRMKa7M). Insist on pure language and you get Dharmendra's character from Chupke Chupke. (BTW, I like Amitabh's character more- 'Aap jaisi khoobsoorat ladki ko botany nahi literature lena chahiye tha', 'muz jaisa nishap, nirdosh lekin majboor character tumhein literature mein bhi nahi milega'.)
