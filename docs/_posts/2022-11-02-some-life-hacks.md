Here are a few life hacks/ tricks I follow/ try to follow to make life simpler, ordered.

1. **No push news.** I have not watched TV news for around 6-7 years. So some things were news to me (pun intended)- like 'last night the PM declared demonetization of certain currencies', etc. Overall though, it has saved me a lot of anxiety. As Kanhemann says in 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', bad news are more popular than good ones and get more broadcast time. As a result the world appears bleak. Steven Pinker demonstrates with data that at macro levels the world is certainly getting better. Instead, I pull news from e-papers, etc. Again, there as well it is more negative than positive, but at least you have a control over what you pull- rather than some items getting bombarded at you.
2. **No TV during meals.** We have associative memories. And that is why some advertisements are targeted at some basic functions, ideas- sex, babies, kids, sportspersons. Eating is a basic function and I have a hypothesis that if we watch TV while eating, we inherently associate a life preserving activity of eating with something which is not essential. (This is like the idea of habit stacking from Atomic Habits.)
3. **Same patterned pairs of socks of a given color.** I have a few colors of trousers, pants, jeans and corresponding colors of socks- blue, black brown, grey, etc. Now suppose I have 5 pairs of blue socks, all of different pattern/ design, then picking them up for wearing unnecessarily takes mind space. And if you are in a hurry, it causes irritation. Instead if I have 10 blue socks of same pattern, picking any two is fine. The idea is like Feynman always having chocolate ice cream as the desert, grey tshirts of Zukerberg, etc.
4. **No digital streaming media after 10.30pm.** Kindle books ok. This helps reduce the blue/white LED light and it reduces late nights.
5. Browse sites like twitter using web browser; if we don't have limit on app usage times, **uninstall the app.**
6. **No multitasking; no background threads.** I at times have TV running in the background while I am doing something else. Mostly it is Seinfeld. I would like to reduce that. Music is ok I think while doing the chores. But if you are watching TV, watch TV. In fact sometimes, while watching a movie on TV, I have played sudoku/ browsed twitter on phone. This kind of multitasking reduces both activities to half-hearted manner. This is bad. It needs to stop.
7. **Consume long form content.** Like books.
