While I consider myself an engineer, I have never confused that with being a hacker of computer systems. The SICP in its first lecture/ chapter, mentions that computer science is not really a science and it's not really about computers. Here is some Perlisism which I found in the book (copied from online SICP book site):

> I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.''

Recently, a manager said something similar. 'Computers are machines; not humans. Don't treat them as living things like humans, or even cats and dogs. They don't have feelings. So we should be merciless in how we use them. You don't have to feed them. All they consume is maybe some electricity. So let them work for you to their limits.'

It usually happens that a thing that you knew forever becomes much- crystal- clearer with just a few words. Maybe pictures. Something external. For example, do you remember when you realized that your country, religion, food, city was probably not the best in the world? While you knew it/ suspected it all along, and while there was no contest as such to rank these things, some external signal just hit the right spot. If you have some physics/ science background I am sure one or two lecture from [Feynman's Messenger Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3_1JNX8dEh5YcO-Y05stU0u_T9nqIlF) would make you experience something like that. Calling it a paradigm shift is not correct really because you were already on that path- it did not alter the path/ direction drastically. It just accelerated the journey- with a push.\*

I experienced something like that- the paradigm shift acceleration feeling- when my manager said that thing about computers. And this idea/ lesson does not have to be always on the foreground in every task I perform, but it is a valuable- for the want of a better word- thought.

\*Of course, sometimes you need to push yourself a little: [https://twitter.com/WholesomeMeme/status/1541813682409046017](https://twitter.com/WholesomeMeme/status/1541813682409046017)
