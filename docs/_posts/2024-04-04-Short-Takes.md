Here I plan to write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. **DRY [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)**
   This principle has been used and abused a lot. The idioms which sound catchy are retained more. For example, why doesn't a stitch in time save ten? Also succinctly put idioms are more popular. For example, you don't have to- as Wodehouse does- explain that- 'An apple a day, if well aimed, keeps the doctor away'. `:laughing:` 
   Anyway, Martin Fowler documents 'Duplicated Code' as a code smell. DRY suggests not repeating some information, code, logic, etc. This is good advice in general but to extract some 'duplicated' code/logic may result into coupling. And as the code evolves, it may become difficult to maintain. So, after taking advice from talks/ discussions, I think that it's better to not repeat yourself within a bounded context. But if the same information is needed outside the boundaries, it's fine to repeat it in respective contexts. It is better to evolve and maintain that way. 
2. **Follow the money**
   If you understand what motivates people, then you understand a lot of what they do. I was once told to ask myself 'why do I do what I do'. Follow the money (trail) was the advice given to Bob Woodword during Watergate as per the film. When it comes to IT, as someone tweeted, a shocking amount of irritating behavior can be explained by "this person is trying to demonstrate their value". As my experience grew, I came to dislike a lot of agile/ process consultant folks. During a phase I wondered why would someone- who had good experience- propagate dogmas like DRY, 100% test coverage, you 'must' write tests first, etc. Then when I sort of understood the motivations I was able to put things into perspective. I used the wording 'sort of' in the previous sentence as I don't think you can fully understand others. Anyway, this model- money here stands for motivation- can help us understand the why part behind a lot of things. Again, for balance, don't read too much into it. People and their actions are sometimes rational and, some other times, irrational.
3. **Entropy**
   The concept of entropy is from the second law of thermodynamics. And it is equally applicable at other places. When thinking about a system, it is good to know that all systems tend towards disorder (high entropy thermal equilibrium). You need to do work to keep the system in order. This work needs to come from outside the system. Also related to the second law is Carnot's principle, which says that there are inherent losses in a system. If you put in 100 units of work, you will see less than 100 units worth of output- never equal to or more than 100. This is why a car left on its own will acquire rust. You need to maintain it by putting in some work. And it feels like you put more work and get less bang for the buck. Same goes for software systems, projects, career. And same goes for health. And for relationships. 
4. **80-20 rule [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)** 
   20% of work takes 80% of efforts.
5. **[Power Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)**
   A variant causes seemingly disproportionate impact. Man reaching Mauritius caused extintion of the Dodo.
6. **[Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)**
   People performing a better role at a level get promoted to higher level where they are not as competent. This is generally accepted as true. But again this is to be taken not as a rule but more as a rule of thumb. Many people at higher levels are actually competent.
7. **[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)**
   Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. In my experience, this is always valid.
8. **[Normal Distribution/ Bell Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)**
   Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution, with some standard deviation and mean. This is why, we will hire only the best candidates generally does not make sense. Even if you hire the best, there will be some who are within bounds of certain sigma value and others beyond those bounds. Need to read more.
9. **[Sunk Cost and Sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)**
10. **[Spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order)** 
    Self organization appears to emerge out of seeming chaos.
11. **[Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)**
   "Free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available."
12. **[The Pygmalion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect)** is a psychological phenomenon in which high expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse performance.
13. "Let's see now. What was Naoko talking about that day?  Of course, the field well."
14. **[The Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)** states that visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. While it is a somewhat contested theory, I use this in my code and life. The extent of effects of ecosystem can be debated upon, but by and large with simplifications, we can say that our environment has effect on us. A laxly written piece of code may give rise to another such code that needs to interact with it. And by induction this can soon grow out of control. That does not mean you should spend disproportionate effort on fixing it (See Broken Window Fallacy). But you know a stitch in time... Similarly, I have come to believe that you should watch your thoughts. Whether true or not, assume that negativity and evil exist and not let them into your mind. We may not always end up making or even have opportunities to make conscious choices. So awareness/ mindfulness is the key I think. "Wake up, Neo. The Matrix has you."
