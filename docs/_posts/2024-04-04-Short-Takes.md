Here I plan to write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. **DRY [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)**
   This principle has been used and abused a lot. The idioms which sound catchy are retained more. For example, why doesn't a stitch in time save ten? Also succinctly put idioms are more popular. For example, you don't have to- as Wodehouse does- explain that- 'An apple a day, if well aimed, keeps the doctor away'. `:laughing:` 
   Anyway, Martin Fowler documents 'Duplicated Code' as a code smell. DRY suggests not repeating some information, code, logic, etc. This is good advice in general but to extract some 'duplicated' code/logic may result into coupling. And as the code evolves, it may become difficult to maintain. So, after taking advice from talks/ discussions, I think that it's better to not repeat yourself within a bounded context. But if the same information is needed outside the boundaries, it's fine to repeat it in respective contexts. It is better to evolve and maintain that way. 
2. **Follow the money**
   If you understand what motivates people, then you understand a lot of what they do. I was once told to ask myself 'why do I do what I do'. Follow the money (trail) was the advice given to Bob Woodword during Watergate as per the film. When it comes to IT, as someone tweeted, a shocking amount of irritating behavior can be explained by "this person is trying to demonstrate their value". As my experience grew, I came to dislike a lot of agile/ process consultant folks. During a phase I wondered why would someone- who had good experience- propagate dogmas like DRY, 100% test coverage, you 'must' write tests first, etc. Then when I sort of understood the motivations I was able to put things into perspective. I used the wording 'sort of' in the previous sentence as I don't think you can fully understand others. Anyway, this model- money here stands for motivation- can help us understand the why part behind a lot of things. Again, for balance, don't read too much into it. People and their actions are sometimes rational and, some other times, irrational.
3. **Entropy**
   The concept of entropy is from the second law of thermodynamics. And it is equally applicable at other places. When thinking about a system, it is good to know that all systems tend towards disorder (high entropy thermal equilibrium). You need to do work to keep the system in order. This work needs to come from outside the system. Also related to the second law is Carnot's principle, which says that there are inherent losses in a system. If you put in 100 units of work, you will see less than 100 units worth of output- never equal to or more than 100. This is why a car left on its own will acquire rust. You need to maintain it by putting in some work. And it feels like you put more work and get less bang for the buck. Same goes for software systems, projects, career. And same goes for health. And for relationships. 
4. **80-20 rule [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)** 
   20% of work takes 80% of efforts.
5. **[Power Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)**
   A variant causes seemingly disproportionate impact. Man reaching Mauritius caused extintion of the Dodo.
6. **[Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)**
   People performing a better role at a level get promoted to higher level where they are not as competent. This is generally accepted as true. But again this is to be taken not as a rule but more as a rule of thumb. Many people at higher levels are actually competent.
7. **[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)**
   Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. In my experience, this is always valid.
8. **[Normal Distribution/ Bell Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)**
   Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution, with some standard deviation and mean. This is why, we will hire only the best candidates generally does not make sense. Even if you hire the best, there will be some who are within bounds of certain sigma value and others beyond those bounds. Need to read more.
9. **[Sunk Cost and Sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)**
10. **[Spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order)** 
    Self organization appears to emerge out of seeming chaos.
11. **[Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)**
   "Free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available."
12. **[The Pygmalion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect)** is a psychological phenomenon in which high expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse performance.
13. "Let's see now. What was Naoko talking about that day? Of course, the field well."
14. **[The Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)** states that visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. While it is a somewhat contested theory, I use this in my code and life. The extent of effects of ecosystem can be debated upon, but by and large with simplifications, we can say that our environment has effect on us. A laxly written piece of code may give rise to another such code that needs to interact with it. And by induction this can soon grow out of control. That does not mean you should spend disproportionate effort on fixing it (See Broken Window Fallacy). But you know a stitch in time... Similarly, I have come to believe that you should watch your thoughts. Whether true or not, assume that negativity and evil exist and not let them into your mind. We may not always end up making or even have opportunities to make conscious choices. So awareness/ mindfulness is the key I think. "Wake up, Neo... The Matrix has you..."
15. To quote from a tweet: "You fall to the level of bullshit you can't detect."
16. "You can't 'selectively' numb emotions." From [a TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability).
17. Shogun TV Series episode 4. Toda Mariko says about her husband's death, "I will inherit his wishes." Wow.
18. [The Cobra Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive) is related to [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) and [Unintended Consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences)
19. The [Paradox of Choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpGgMdDimKY) says that you would be happier with your choice when you have a comparatively smaller number of options to choose from. While [options are necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice#Summary), increasing the number of options beyond a certain threshold yeilds unsatisfactory results. I haven't read the book. But I think it makes sense. It is said to be applicable for consumer products, dating, etc. A typical career advice says that you should choose a career path that will open a few options to choose from. Try out a few of these and when you find your interest inclining towards one of those options, commit to that. [Longer talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMV4PIEIKY4) by the author of the book. Again, things like this are not pure science so your mileage may vary.
20. Stephen Fry on [differences between British and American comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao). Of course, it's not always this black and white. But, in general, it seems to make sense. Also, once an American TV series succeeds, they seem to think of it in terms of cash cow and want to repeat the success 'formula' till it's boring. Occasionally, I may like a season of [Gilmore Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_t0aH4pbCI). Also, consider GG or Mrs. Maisel by the same creator. I just don't understand [where do they summon this enthusiasm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLSXjYKyGgU) from. (Unless it's from market demand.) I'd prefer Fleabag kind of awkward and cringeworthy comedy based on loss/ tragedy to wisecracks of GG. The lines like [it's God, isn't it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTe53InEQR4) make you [want to cry all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev9JVzQey44).
21. Contact is probably my most favorite sci-fi movie. And [the scene of contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCkbekhUdw4&ab_channel=THESSALONIAN31N) is [quite thrilling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ciK05XqlOw&ab_channel=THESSALONIAN31N). (Also, I like 'they should have sent a poet'. Of course, there are a lot of great scenes: young Ellie running upstairs to fetch medicine bottle, the opening scene of the movie from noisy to quiet, etc.) While the movie deviates from the book quite a bit and does not include some parts, I liked both. Carl Sagan was involved with the movie. [Euclid's theorem about infinitude of prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem) is quite profound with simple proof(s).
22. [Availability Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)/ heuristic
23. [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
24. [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
25. [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
26. [Greater good and lesser evil principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_of_two_evils_principle) 'Greater good' is from Spinoza's quote/ maxim in the linked article. But the principle is primarily known as lesser evil principle. A lot of choices turn out to be not as bad-vs-good but instead as bad-vs-worse. (Of course, definitions of good or bad are subjective, situation dependent, relative, etc.) And most of the times we are so used to this that we don't even really notice that the choice we made might have been lesser but evil nonetheless. Because of complex and dynamic nature of systems, we learn to live with our choices. Life would be hell if we couldn't. This is more pronounced in case of widely participated systems like bi/ multi party politics. But the principle holds equally true in other areas like technology, etc. There is no ideal technology. So the best a programmer can do is being pragmatic.
27. Over the last 2-3 months I listened to many episodes of the acquired podcast. Notable ones: [Taylor Swift](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/taylor-swift-acquireds-version), [LVMH](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/lvmh), [Starbucks](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/starbucks-with-howard-schultz), [Microsoft](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/microsoft), [Hermès](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/hermes), [Porsche](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/porsche-with-doug-demuro), [Lockheed Martin](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/lockheed-martin). All of these have been noteworthy ones. Apart from Microsoft, I did not know much about any of the other brands and phenomena. I was aware about Taylor Swift and that she's a phenomenon. But I hadn't listened to a single complete Taylor Swift song before. And, I am ashamed to say, I still haven't... Yeah, I know. Sorry about that. But maybe someone can educate me and tell me where to begin. I have listened to Microsoft first part more than once and am waiting for the next parts to be released. Again, all of these episodes were interesting. How could a Lockheed Martin story not be interesting? And Hermès story has Grace Kelly in it. So... After listening to these stories, I now have huge respect for Hermès (though I think their model succeeds because of the brand value), and I know that LVMH kind of corporate games may be too much for me.
28. **[Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)** is an important model to understand motivations and drivers of human behavior. As per the wikipedia entry, while he never created pyramid to represent the hierarchy, `Maslow used the terms "physiological", "safety", "belonging and love", "social needs" or "esteem", "self-actualization" and "transcendence" to describe the pattern through which human needs and motivations generally move. This means that, according to the theory, for motivation to arise at the next stage, each prior stage must be satisfied by an individual.` Put in a concrete example, if your wife is not getting laid, you cannot have intellectually stimulating discussions with her. If that sounded a bit weird, we should acknowledge that this is a generalized framework. Individuals may differ. As the wikipedia entry says (Criticism section), `academically, Maslow's idea is heavily contested... the exact hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question`.
29. **Bike Shedding** or [Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) People within an organization commonly give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. For example, a committee whose job is to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spends the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.
30. **[Linda Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy)**. Even after becoming aware of this fallacy, I have fallen prey to it many times and have also seen other people doing so. This is not surprising- even Stephen J. Gould... The difference is this: After I became aware of my bias, I immediately corrected myself. On the contrary, when I notice my friends making these kinds of mistakes and I explain this fallacy with Linda example, some of them are still not able to accept that it applies to their situations and choices. Maybe (as wikipedia mentions) the wording/ framing of the Linda problem could be a thing.
