Here I plan to write about some concepts, phrases, models, ideas related to my work and life. As these are likely to be known to many, the idea is to just document these together, rather than go into details of these. Will keep updating.

1. **DRY [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)**
   This principle has been used and abused a lot. The idioms which sound catchy are retained more. For example, why doesn't a stitch in time save ten? Also succinctly put idioms are more popular. For example, you don't have to- as Wodehouse does- explain that- 'An apple a day, if well aimed, keeps the doctor away'. :laughing: 
   Anyway, Martin Fowler documents 'Duplicated Code' as a code smell. DRY suggests not repeating some information, code, logic, etc. This is good advice in general but to extract some 'duplicated' code/logic may result into coupling. And as the code evolves, it may become difficult to maintain. So, after taking advice from talks/ discussions, I think that it's better to not repeat yourself within a bounded context. But if the same information is needed outside the boundaries, it's fine to repeat it in respective contexts. It is better to evolve and maintain that way. 
2. **Follow the money**
   If you understand what motivates people, then you understand a lot of what they do. I was once told to ask myself 'why do I do what I do'. Follow the money was the advice given to Bob Woodword during Watergate as per the film. When it comes to IT, as someone tweeted, a shocking amount of irritating behavior can be explained by "this person is trying to demonstrate their value". As my experience grew, I came to dislike a lot of agile/ process consultant folks. During a phase I wondered why would someone- who had good experience- propogate dogmas like DRY, 100% test coverage, you 'must' write tests first, etc. Then when I sort of understood the motivations and was able to put things into perspective. I used the wording 'sort of' in the previous sentence as I don't think you can fully understand others. Anyway, this model- money here stands for motivation- can help us understand the why part behind a lot of things. Again, for balance, don't read too much into it. People and their actions are sometimes rational and, some other times, irrational.
3. **Entropy**
   The concept of entropy is from the second law of thermodynamics. And it is equally applicable at other places. When thinking about a system, it is good to know that all systems tend towards disorder (high entropy thermal equilibrium). You need to do work to keep the system in order. This work needs to come from outside the system. Also related to the second law is Carnot's principle, which says that there are inherent losses in a system. If you put in 100 units of work, you will see less than 100 units worth of output- never equal to or more than 100. This is why a car left on its own will acquire rust. You need to maintain it by putting in some work. And it feels like you put more work and get less bang for the buck. Same goes for software systems, projects, career. And same goes for health. And for relationships.
