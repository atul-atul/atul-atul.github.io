Well, the thing is that data is a big deal. It probably has always been. From Sumerian artifacts mentioning barter transactions to the current third wave (Toffler). Of course, data is important because of the information we can derive from it. But that is just one way of looking at that statement. From business perspective information systems are very important. But from an engineer's perspective, dealing with data is where the rubber meets the road. And if data is not good, you cannot design good solutions to problems.

In general- that is to say, not only in software- many of the difficult problems are not clearly defined. In fact that is one of the reasons those problems are difficult. A big part is defining the problem in the first place. I remember one of my engineering text books (Design of Machine Element by Bhandari) defined stages of machine design. The first stage was identification of need. It came before defining the problem. And then there were subsequent stages. For example, you need clean breathable air. The problem could be air pollution. Even clearer definition could yield the problem as smog caused not by the stubble burning but because of large number of vehicles, and the further clarification could take us towards mass transit systems or decentralization of business districts or industrial pockets.

You probably heard/ read this example- possibly in design thinking/ IDEO context- where the narrator describes the problem of air pollution, sickness, accidents and deaths caused by vehicular pollution and rash vehicles, road safety issues, etc. And you think this is the current scenario being described which is caused by fossil fuel powered cars. But the description of all those issues of pollution, foul air, road safety issues turns out to be from the Victorian era London where all these issues were caused by a large number of horse driven carriages, buggies, hansom cabs, etc. So identifying the need of clean breathable air may result in solving not the problem of fossil fuels but finding better alternative to horse driven carriages.

Data as such probably does not carry any meaning unless it is transformed into information. But if you torture data long enough, it will confess to anything. The data can be bent or plotted on several axes which can result in different information. (In Ed Tufte's book- Visual Display of Quantitative Information, he mentions that a few very different looking graphs/ charts were created from the same set of data.

As a software engineer, I have tried to get into dealing with some big data based intelligence systems. So far have not reached there yet.

Also, I think I should finish reading the following books first:

Visual Display of Quantitative Information

Designing Data Driven Applications.
