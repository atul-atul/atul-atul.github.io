Kevin Kelly wrote about 1000 true fans. In 2008. Here is [a link](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) to a version of that. (I have read the essay in the past- but not in last five years. After all these years, I still miss Google Reader.)

After that, a lot has changed (iPhone was launched in 2007 and changed a lot of things in a few years). I recently heard an opinion that 1000 is no longer a necessary number. These days the number is much smaller. This is because the online content creation and distribution have become very easy thanks to the ubiquitous internet connectivity. The hierarchies on the content creation side have collapsed, the content consumption has skyrocketed, billing methods are no longer one time payment (products are now billed more as a service, PAYG), etc.

But users push the content creators in certain directions. Style, content, etc. can become formulaic.

Twitter is/ was one of the best content platforms I came across. I could choose the kind of content I was interested in. I had to mute certain words and then my feed became clean. You have to guard good things like that- otherwise Kardashians start popping into your feed.

The recent twitter happenings are a bit confusing and worst of all they are being discussed a lot. So it amplifies the signal and makes you worry if twitter has lost it. I don't think so yet. But the bot problem has to be addressed. I don't have a facebook account but I think because it focused on real people (by initially mandating .edu, etc. IDs and then via invites), they probably don't have this particular problem as serious as twitter.

This blog does not have many repeat visitors. At least I don't see a pattern. That's good because I don't think this is targeted with readers in mind. (In fact, I have removed some of the subscribers from this blog. Who does that, you may ask. But they did not seem authentic. Even today, before writing this post, I removed a subscriber. Also, I have disabled likes, added a sticky post about recently read books, etc.) A bothersome observation I see that maybe there are a few bots visiting. I am not sure if that is really the case. Sometimes it is the sites/ people who in turn want you to visit their site so as to increase the number of visitors to their sites. Maybe some readers are real people (I would certainly like to know and who they are). But even more I'm not sure if the visitors actually read anything. Sometimes search engines drive a few folks here (I can see the uptick and guess that maybe there is a technical conference going on certain topic about which I have written here; and there I can guess that those people- whoever they are- are real).

I have same blog on duplicated on github pages and there the trends are visible but my site does not get as much traffic there. So as of now, that gives me somewhat disconnected independence there. Also, the stats are a bit under the wraps there (as of now and for my page at least). So out of sight is out of mind holds true there.
