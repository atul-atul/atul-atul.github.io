A recent purchase. Visual Display Of Quantitative Information by Ed Tufte. I will start reading it soon. There is a big reading list queue. But will probably bump it to near the top.

I have heard very good feedback about the book. At least 10-12 years ago. Separately from two of my friends. And this was on the list/ in the back of mind since then. But, while price was not a concern really, I never ended up buying it before now.

Indian editions of books are pathetic. I mean those low cost editions are necessary considering the amount we can afford to spend on books. But the paper quality, colors, etc. are compromised in the process. And due to demand vs supply arithmetic, the good editions are not available. (I remember purchasing Calvin And Hobbes collection in Melbourne because these were not available in India then.) But this hardcover edition of Tufte's book is good quality.

Here is something from introduction of this book. The author had very specific ideas about how the book should look and as a result decided to self-publish the book.

> To finance the book I took out another mortgage on my home. The bank office said this was the second most unusual loan that she had ever made; first place belonged to a loan to a circus to buy an elephant!

How could one resist such passion for the craft!
