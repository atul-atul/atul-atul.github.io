This is probably the costliest recent book purchase. Visual Display Of Quantitative Information by Ed Tufte. I have spent more money for books, I am sure. But for a single book outside required- say course curriculum- books, this is probably near the top in recent times.

I will start reading it soon. There is a huge queue. But will probably bump it to near the top.

I have heard very good feedback about the book. At least 10-12 years ago. Separately, from two of my friends. And this was on the list/ in the back of mind since then. But, while price was not a concern really, I never ended up buying it before now.

Indian editions of books are pathetic. I mean those low cost editions are necessary considering the amount we can afford to spend on books. But the paper quality, colors, etc. are compromised in the process. And due to demand vs supply arithmetic, the good editions are not available. (I remember purchasing Calvin And Hobbes collection in Melbourne because these were not available in India then.)

Here is something from introduction of this book. The author had very specific demands on how the book should look and as a result decided to self-publish the book. And "To finance the book I took out another mortgage on my home. The bank office said this was the second most unusual loan that she had ever made; first place belonged to a loan to a circus to buy an elephant!"

How could one resist such passion for the craft!
