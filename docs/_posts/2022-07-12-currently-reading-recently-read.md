**Currently Reading July 2022:**

Thinking In Systems- Meadows

How Buildings Learn: What happens after they're built- Stewart Brand

Why The Allies Won- Overy (re-read)

Half Lion: How P V Narasimha Rao Transformed India- Vinay Sitapati (The author said on The Seen And The Unseen podcast [episode](https://seenunseen.in/episodes/2022/6/27/episode-283-the-forgotten-greatness-of-pv-narasimha-rao/) that the book was about understanding how PVNRao was able to get the reforms rolling with strong opposition, almost no control or power in the parliament and within his party. So it is about how to influence when you don't have much power or control. How could you resist a book with such premise?)
