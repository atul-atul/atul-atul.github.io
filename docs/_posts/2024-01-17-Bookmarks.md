Here I plan to note down links, etc. which I found interesting/ planned to visit later. Some of these may be half-read. Tech/non-Tech I will keep on updating this every now and then.

1. [Load Balancing](https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/)
2. [10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2024/1/278891-10-things-software-developers-should-learn-about-learning/fulltext)
3. [Mechanical Watch](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) and other posts on the site look very interesting.
4. [What is in that .git directory?](https://blog.meain.io/2023/what-is-in-dot-git/) `...for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.`
5. [Cars can be allergic to vanilla ice-cream](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wkw/humour/carproblems.txt) Understanding the problem can be the key.
6. [Seinfeld Scripts](https://www.seinfeldscripts.com/seinfeld-scripts.html) `You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld; but you are no Comedian.`
7. [Serverless may not be good for you](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90)
8. [Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere!](https://www.folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html) Why techies need to be rooted in the world they operate in. But avoid [Close Encounters of the Steve Kind](https://www.macfolklore.org/Close_Encounters_of_the_Steve_Kind.html) with the engineers.
9. [ExRx](https://exrx.net/Lists/Directory)
10. [Common Weakness Enumeration- a sample](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
11. [Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwix5PoqRIFNFxBcVsrcq2CrnVvbkexVR) and [Smiley's People](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwix5PoqRIFOqIAlXTNGp4pCXu8HLhnWF) TV adaptations as best as any can be.
12. [Solar system distances if the moon were one pixel](https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)
13. [How many moons does the earth have?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIqOsM6_3Dw&ab_channel=QI)
14. [Technology behind a one-person Internet company](https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/)
15. [API versioning at Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning) I have consumed a lot of material on versioning of APIs. But this is the best content I came across so far. First read in 2017 when it's posted.
16. Thanks to [Open Culture](https://www.openculture.com/) I watched [Anna Karenina](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7EqAsBxqGgihPlmmGKJuRE7UKxYTPkrh). Long ago, I started reading the book but did not finish it. I remember Levin when he is back home from the ball where Kitty was smitten by Vronksy and hasn't paid Levin much attention,  and his dog comes and sits by him and 'understands' his emotions. This version does not have the Kitty Levin subplot. But anyway, there are areas where screen adaptations can be better and areas where they are much short of the books.
17. [Third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) makes so much sense. It's late. But I need to develop one for myself.
18. [David Perell's Friday Finds Links](https://perell.com/friday-finds-links/)
19. [Why the Future Doesn't Need Us](https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/) Read this 2017-18, I think. Should re-read?
