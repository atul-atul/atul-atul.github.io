Here I plan to note down links, etc. which I found interesting/ planned to visit later. Some of these may be half-read. Tech/non-Tech I will keep on updating this every now and then.

1. [Load Balancing](https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/)
2. [10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2024/1/278891-10-things-software-developers-should-learn-about-learning/fulltext)
3. [Mechanical Watch](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) and other posts on the site look very interesting.
4. [What is in that .git directory?](https://blog.meain.io/2023/what-is-in-dot-git/) `...for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.`
5. [Cars can be allergic to vanilla ice-cream](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wkw/humour/carproblems.txt) Understanding the problem can be the key.
6. [Seinfeld Scripts](https://www.seinfeldscripts.com/seinfeld-scripts.html) `You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld; but you are no Comedian.`
7. [Serverless may not be good for you](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325042615/https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90)
8. [Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere!](https://www.folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html) Why techies need to be rooted in the world they operate in. But avoid [Close Encounters of the Steve Kind](https://www.folklore.org/Close_Encounters_of_the_Steve_Kind.html) with engineers.
9. [ExRx](https://exrx.net/Lists/Directory)
10. [Common Weakness Enumeration- a sample](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
11. [Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwix5PoqRIFNFxBcVsrcq2CrnVvbkexVR) and [Smiley's People](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwix5PoqRIFOqIAlXTNGp4pCXu8HLhnWF) TV adaptations as best as any can be.
12. [Solar system distances if the moon were one pixel](https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)
13. [How many moons does the earth have?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIqOsM6_3Dw&ab_channel=QI)
14. [Technology behind a one-person Internet company](https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/)
15. [API versioning at Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning) I have consumed a lot of material on versioning of APIs. But this is the best content I came across so far. First read in 2017 when it's posted.
16. Thanks to [Open Culture](https://www.openculture.com/) I watched [Anna Karenina](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7EqAsBxqGgihPlmmGKJuRE7UKxYTPkrh). Long ago, I started reading the book but did not finish it. I remember Levin when he is back home from the ball where Kitty was smitten by Vronksy and hasn't paid Levin much attention,  and his dog comes and sits by him and 'understands' his emotions. This version does not have the Kitty Levin subplot. But anyway, there are areas where screen adaptations can be better and areas where they are much short of the books.
17. [Third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) makes so much sense. It's late. But I need to develop one for myself.
18. [David Perell's Friday Finds Links](https://perell.com/friday-finds-links/)
19. [Why the Future Doesn't Need Us](https://archive.org/download/why-the-future-doesnt-need-us-wired/Why%20the%20Future%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Us%20_%20WIRED.pdf) Read this 2017-18, I think. Should re-read? 
20. [The 5 laws of API dates and times](https://apiux.com/2013/03/20/5-laws-api-dates-and-times/)
21. [Before making your site public](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/46716/what-technical-details-should-a-programmer-of-a-web-application-consider-before)
22. [Buy It For Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/). Things that last long. In the age of full-blown consumerism and planned obsolescence, it should be worthwhile shortlisting recommended products and brands in the areas of interest. While not many brands are available in India, I have made an amazon list from my visits to the page (mainly from all time top posts).
23. Chuck Norris/ Rajinikanth style 'facts' about [Jeff Dean](https://www.informatika.bg/jeffdean) and [Jon Skeet](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9134/jon-skeet-facts).
24. [Recursion, Calvin And Hobbes Style](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2024/3/24)
25. Recently came across the [Acquired podcast](https://www.acquired.fm/). Seems interesting. "Acquired tells the stories and strategies of great companies." I have listened to Visa and Nike episodes and am halfway through the Sony one. Good information- and so far it seems to fit their own understanding that episodes 'are better described as "conversational audiobooks" than "podcasts"'. This saves some precious reading hours. For example, I purchased the book Shoe Dog but have not read it yet. And I am not sure when I would get to reading it. But this podcast can serve that intro purpose for me, I think. Then if I am very curious about any of these companies/ topics/ related threads, I can go into details- which at the moment I am not.
26. Photos- Europe, aurora 2024 [live](https://www.foto-webcam.eu/webcam/lucknerhaus/) and [some of the best ones](https://www.foto-webcam.eu/webcam/bestof/) and some clicked [at specific time](https://www.foto-webcam.eu/2024/05/10/2230)
27. [BBC's Sound effects library](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search)
28. I thought I had watched all Joe Armstrong talks on youtube. But when I recently re-watched his the talk 'The Mess We're In', [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNICGEwmXLU) came up as a recommendation. It has same old content- almost nothing new.
29. While I have watched it only once, I am pretty sure I will be watching [this talk by Christopher Alexander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98LdFA-_zfA) a few more times. (His book A Pattern Language inspired Object Oriented Design Patterns in software.)
30. Aren't you the sweetest! [Just saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Z6pWhM6TA).
31. [Akira Kurosawa - Composing Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doaQC-S8de8).
32. Very early on, you learn that when she's working or in any social setting you shouldn't call your girlfriend by her pet name. She may in turn call you grandpa. Of course, that's not too bad if she's [this sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1te_Xg1hfk).
33. Some [blind spots of platform engineering](https://gotopia.tech/articles/380)
